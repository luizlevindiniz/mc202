TheSonnets

                    

From Fairest Creatures We Desire Increase
That Thereby Beautys Rose Might Never Die
But AstheRiper Should By Time Decease
His Tender Heir Might Bear His Memory
But Thou ContractedtoThine Own Bright Eyes
Feedst Thy Lights Flame With Selfsubstantial Fuel
MakingaFamine Where Abundance Lies
Thyself Thy FoetoThy Sweet Self Too Cruel
Thou That Art NowtheWorlds Fresh Ornament
And Only Herald TotheGaudy Spring
Within Thine Own Bud Buriest Thy Content
And Tender Churl Makst WasteinNiggarding
  PitytheWorld Or Else This Glutton Be
 toEattheWorlds Due BytheGrave And Thee


                    

When Forty Winters Shall Besiege Thy Brow
And Dig Deep TrenchesinThy Beautys Field
Thy Youths Proud Livery So Gazed On Now
Will BeaTattered WeedofSmall Worth Held
Then Being Asked Where All Thy Beauty Lies
Where AlltheTreasureofThy Lusty Days
To Say Within Thine Own Deep Sunken Eyes
Were An Alleating Shame And Thriftless Praise
How Much More Praise Deservd Thy Beautys Use
If Thou Couldst Answer This Fair ChildofMine
Shall Sum My Count And Make My Old Excuse
Proving His Beauty By Succession Thine
  This WeretoBe New Made When Thou Art Old
  And See Thy Blood Warm When Thou Feelst It Cold


                    

LookinThy Glass And TelltheFace Thou Viewest
Now IstheTime That Face Should Form Another
Whose Fresh Repair If Now Thou Not Renewest
Thou Dost BeguiletheWorld Unbless Some Mother
For WhereisShe So Fair Whose Uneared Womb
DisdainstheTillageofThy Husbandry
Or WhoisHe So Fond Will BetheTomb
Of His SelflovetoStop Posterity
Thou Art Thy Mothers Glass And SheinThee
Calls BacktheLovely AprilofHer Prime
So Thou Through WindowsofThine Age Shalt See
DespiteofWrinkles This Thy Golden Time
  But If Thou Live Remembered NottoBe
  Die Single And Thine Image Dies With Thee


                    

Unthrifty Loveliness Why Dost Thou Spend
Upon Thyself Thy Beautys Legacy
Natures Bequest Gives Nothing But Doth Lend
And Being Frank She LendstoThose Are Free
Then Beauteous Niggard Why Dost Thou Abuse
TheBounteous Largess Given TheetoGive
Profitless Usurer Why Dost Thou Use
So GreataSumofSums Yet Canst Not Live
For Having Traffic With Thyself Alone
ThouofThyself Thy Sweet Self Dost Deceive
Then How When Nature Calls TheetoBe Gone
What Acceptable Audit Canst Thou Leave
  Thy Unused Beauty MustbeTombed With Thee
  Which Used Lives Th ExecutortoBe


                    

Those Hours That With Gentle Work Did Frame
TheLovely Gaze Where Every Eye Doth Dwell
Will PlaytheTyrants TotheVery Same
And That Unfair Which Fairly Doth Excel
For Neverresting Time Leads Summer On
To Hideous Winter And Confounds Him There
Sap Checked With Frost And Lusty Leaves Quite Gone
Beauty Oersnowed And Bareness Every Where
Then Were Not Summers Distillation Left
A Liquid Prisoner PentinWallsofGlass
Beautys Effect With Beauty Were Bereft
Nor It Nor No Remembrance What It Was
  But Flowers Distilled Though They With Winter Meet
  Leese But Their Show Their Substance Still Lives Sweet


                    

Then Let Not Winters Ragged Hand Deface
In Thee Thy Summer Ere ThoubeDistilled
Make Sweet Some Vial Treasure Thou Some Place
With Beautys Treasure Ere ItbeSelfkilled
That UseisNot Forbidden Usury
Which Happies Those That PaytheWilling Loan
Thats For ThyselftoBreed Another Thee
Or Ten Times HappierbeIt Ten For One
Ten Times Thyself Were Happier Than Thou Art
If TenofThine Ten Times Refigured Thee
Then What Could Death Do If Thou Shouldst Depart
Leaving Thee LivinginPosterity
 beNot Selfwilled For Thou Art Much Too Fair
 toBe Deaths Conquest And Make Worms Thine Heir


                    

LoinTheOrient WhentheGracious Light
Lifts Up His Burning Head Each Under Eye
Doth HomagetoHis Newappearing Sight
Serving With Looks His Sacred Majesty
And Having ClimbedtheSteepup Heavenly Hill
Resembling Strong YouthinHis Middle Age
Yet Mortal Looks Adore His Beauty Still
Attending On His Golden Pilgrimage
But When From Highmost Pitch With Weary Car
Like Feeble Age He Reeleth FromtheDay
TheEyes Fore Duteous Now Converted Are
From His Low Tract And Look Another Way
  So Thou Thyself OutgoinginThy Noon
  Unlooked On Diest Unless Thou GetaSon


                    

MusictoHear Why Hearst Thou Music Sadly
Sweets With Sweets War Not Joy DelightsinJoy
Why Lovst Thou That Which Thou Receivst Not Gladly
Or Else Receivst With Pleasure Thine Annoy
IftheTrue ConcordofWelltuned Sounds
By Unions Married Do Offend Thine Ear
They Do But Sweetly Chide Thee Who Confounds
In SinglenesstheParts That Thou Shouldst Bear
Mark How One String Sweet HusbandtoAnother
Strikes EachinEach By Mutual Ordering
Resembling Sire And Child And Happy Mother
Who AllinOne One Pleasing Note Do Sing
  Whose Speechless Song Being Many Seeming One
  Sings ThistoThee Thou Single Wilt Prove None


                    

Is It For FeartoWetaWidows Eye
That Thou Consumst ThyselfinSingle Life
Ah If Thou Issueless Shalt HaptoDie
TheWorld Will Wail Thee LikeaMakeless Wife
TheWorld WillbeThy Widow And Still Weep
That Thou No FormofThee Hast Left Behind
When Every Private Widow Well May Keep
By Childrens Eyes Her Husbands ShapeinMind
Look What An UnthriftinTheWorld Doth Spend
Shifts But His Place For StilltheWorld Enjoys It
But Beautys Waste HathinTheWorld An End
And Kept UnusedtheUser So Destroys It
  No Love Toward OthersinThat Bosom Sits
  That On Himself Such Murdrous Shame Commits


                    

For Shame Deny That Thou Bearst LovetoAny
Who For Thyself Art So Unprovident
Grant If Thou Wilt Thou Art BelovedofMany
But That Thou None LovstisMost Evident
For Thou Art So Possessed With Murdrous Hate
That Gainst Thyself Thou Stickst NottoConspire
Seeking That Beauteous RooftoRuinate
WhichtoRepair ShouldbeThy Chief Desire
O Change Thy Thought ThatIMay Change My Mind
Shall HatebeFairer Lodged Than Gentle Love
BeasThy PresenceisGracious And Kind
OrtoThyself At Least Kindhearted Prove
  Make Thee Another Self For LoveofMe
  That Beauty Still May LiveinThine Or Thee


                    

As FastasThou Shalt Wane So Fast Thou Growst
In OneofThine From That Which Thou Departest
And That Fresh Blood Which Youngly Thou Bestowst
Thou Mayst Call Thine When Thou From Youth Convertest
Herein Lives Wisdom Beauty And Increase
Without This Folly Age And Cold Decay
If All Were Minded SotheTimes Should Cease
And Threescore Year Would MaketheWorld Away
Let Those Whom Nature Hath Not Made For Store
Harsh Featureless And Rude Barrenly Perish
Look Whom She Best Endowed She Gave Thee More
Which Bounteous Gift Thou ShouldstinBounty Cherish
  She Carved Thee For Her Seal And Meant Thereby
  Thou Shouldst Print More Not Let That Copy Die


                    

WhenIDo CounttheClock That TellstheTime
And SeetheBrave Day SunkinHideous Night
WhenIBeholdtheViolet Past Prime
And Sable Curls All Silvered Oer With White
When Lofty TreesISee BarrenofLeaves
Which Erst From Heat Did CanopytheHerd
And Summers Green All Girded UpinSheaves
Borne OntheBier With White And Bristly Beard
ThenofThy Beauty DoIQuestion Make
That Thou AmongtheWastesofTime Must Go
Since Sweets And Beauties Do Themselves Forsake
And DieasFastasThey See Others Grow
  And Nothing Gainst Times ScytheCan Make Defence
  Save BreedtoBrave Him When He Takes Thee Hence


                    

O That You Were Your Self But Love You Are
No Longer Yours Than You Yourself Here Live
Against This Coming End You Should Prepare
And Your Sweet SemblancetoSome Other Give
So Should That Beauty Which You HoldinLease
Find No Determination Then You Were
Yourself Again After Yourselfs Decease
When Your Sweet Issue Your Sweet Form Should Bear
Who Lets So FairaHouse FalltoDecay
Which HusbandryinHonour Might Uphold
AgainsttheStormy GustsofWinters Day
And Barren RageofDeaths Eternal Cold
  O None But Unthrifts Dear My Love You Know
  You HadaFather Let Your Son Say So


                    

Not FromtheStars DoIMy Judgement Pluck
And Yet MethinksIHave Astronomy
But NottoTellofGood Or Evil Luck
Of PlaguesofDearths Or Seasons Quality
Nor CanIFortunetoBrief Minutes Tell
PointingtoEach His Thunder Rain And Wind
Or Say With Princes If It Shall Go Well
By Oft Predict That IinHeaven Find
But From Thine Eyes My KnowledgeIDerive
And Constant StarsinThemIRead Such Art
As Truth And Beauty Shall Together Thrive
If From ThyselftoStore Thou Wouldst Convert
  Or ElseofThee ThisIPrognosticate
  Thy EndisTruths And Beautys Doom And Date


                    

WhenIConsider Everything That Grows
HoldsinPerfection ButaLittle Moment
That This Huge Stage Presenteth Nought But Shows
WhereontheStarsinSecret Influence Comment
WhenIPerceive That MenasPlants Increase
Cheered And Checked Even BytheSelfsame Sky
VauntinTheir Youthful Sap At Height Decrease
And Wear Their Brave State OutofMemory
ThentheConceitofThis Inconstant Stay
Sets You Most RichinYouth Before My Sight
Where Wasteful Time Debateth With Decay
To Change Your DayofYouthtoSullied Night
  And AllinWar With Time For LoveofYou
 asHe Takes From YouIEngraft You New


                    

But Wherefore Do Not YouaMightier Way
Make War Upon This Bloody Tyrant Time
And Fortify YourselfinYour Decay
With Means More Blessed Than My Barren Rhyme
Now Stand You OntheTopofHappy Hours
And Many Maiden Gardens Yet Unset
With Virtuous Wish Would Bear You Living Flowers
Much Liker Than Your Painted Counterfeit
So ShouldtheLinesofLife That Life Repair
Which This Times Pencil Or My Pupil Pen
NeitherinInward Worth Nor Outward Fair
Can Make You Live YourselfinEyesofMen
 toGive Away Yourself Keeps Yourself Still
  And You Must Live Drawn By Your Own Sweet Skill


                    

Who Will Believe My VerseinTimetoCome
If It Were Filled With Your Most High Deserts
Though Yet Heaven Knows ItisBut AsaTomb
Which Hides Your Life And Shows Not Half Your Parts
IfICould WritetheBeautyofYour Eyes
AndinFresh Numbers Number All Your Graces
TheAgetoCome Would Say This Poet Lies
Such Heavenly Touches Neer Touched Earthly Faces
So Should My Papers Yellowed With Their Age
Be Scorned Like Old MenofLess Truth Than Tongue
And Your True RightsbeTermedaPoets Rage
And Stretched MetreofAn Antique Song
  But Were Some ChildofYours Alive That Time
  You Should Live Twicein It AndinMy Rhyme

And Summers Lease Hath All Too ShortaDate
Sometime Too HottheEyeofHeaven Shines
And OftenisHis Gold Complexion Dimmed
And Every Fair From Fair Sometime Declines
By Chance Or Natures Changing Course Untrimmed
But Thy Eternal Summer Shall Not Fade
Nor Lose PossessionofThat Fair Thou Owst
Nor Shall Death Brag Thou WandrestinHis Shade
WheninEternal LinestoTime Thou Growst
  So LongasMen Can BreatheOr Eyes Can See
  So Long Lives This And This Gives LifetoThee

And BurntheLonglived PhoenixinHer Blood

And Do Whateer Thou Wilt Swiftfooted Time
TotheWide World And All Her Fading Sweets
ButIForbid Thee One Most Heinous Crime
O Carve Not With Thy Hours My Loves Fair Brow
Nor Draw No Lines There With Thine Antique Pen
HiminThy Course Untainted Do Allow
For Beautys PatterntoSucceeding Men
  Yet Do Thy Worst Old Time Despite Thy Wrong
  My Love ShallinMy Verse Ever Live Young


                    

A Womans Face With Natures Own Hand Painted
Hast ThoutheMaster MistressofMy Passion
A Womans Gentle Heart But Not Acquainted
With Shifting Change AsisFalse Womens Fashion
An Eye More Bright Than Theirs Less FalseinRolling

A ManinHue All HuesinHis Controlling
Which Steals Mens Eyes And Womens Souls Amazeth
And ForaWoman Wert Thou First Created
Till NatureasShe Wrought Thee Fell Adoting
And By Addition MeofThee Defeated
By Adding One ThingtoMy Purpose Nothing
  But Since She Pricked Thee Out For Womens Pleasure
  MinebeThy Love And Thy Loves Use Their Treasure


                    

SoisIt Not With MeasWith That Muse
Stirred ByaPainted BeautytoHis Verse
Who Heaven It Self For Ornament Doth Use
And Every Fair With His Fair Doth Rehearse
MakingaCouplementofProud Compare
With Sun And Moon With Earth And Seas Rich Gems
With Aprils Firstborn Flowers And All Things Rare
That Heavens AirinThis Huge Rondure Hems
O Let Me TrueinLove But Truly Write
And Then Believe Me My LoveisAs Fair
As Any Mothers Child Though Not So Bright
As Those Gold Candles FixedinHeavens Air
  Let Them Say More That LikeofHearsay Well
 IWill Not Praise That Purpose NottoSell


                    

My Glass Shall Not Persuade MeIAm Old
So LongasYouth And Thou AreofOne Date
But WheninThee Times FurrowsIBehold
Then LookIDeath My Days Should Expiate
For All That Beauty That Doth Cover Thee
Is ButtheSeemly RaimentofMy Heart
WhichinThy Breast Doth LiveasThineinMe
How CanIThenbeElder Than Thou Art
O Therefore Love BeofThyself So Wary
AsINot For My Self But For Thee Will
Bearing Thy Heart WhichIWill Keep So Chary
As Tender Nurse Her Babe From Faring Ill
  Presume Not On Thy Heart When MineisSlain
  Thou Gavst Me Thine NottoGive Back Again


                    

As An Unperfect Actor OntheStage

Or Some Fierce Thing Replete With Too Much Rage
Whose Strengths Abundance Weakens His Own Heart
SoIFor FearofTrust ForgettoSay

AndinMine Own Loves Strength SeemtoDecay
Oercharged With BurthenofMine Own Loves Might
O Let My LooksbeThentheEloquence
And Dumb PresagersofMy Speaking Breast
Who Plead For Love And Look For Recompense
More Than That Tongue That More Hath More Expressed
  O LearntoRead What Silent Love Hath Writ

Mine Eye Hath PlayedthePainter And Hath Stelled
Thy Beautys ForminTableofMy Heart
My Body IstheFrame Wherein Tis Held
And Perspective ItisBest Painters Art
For ThroughthePainter Must You See His Skill
To Find Where Your True Image Pictured Lies
WhichinMy Bosoms ShopisHanging Still
That Hath His Windows Glazed With Thine Eyes
Now See What Good Turns Eyes For Eyes Have Done
Mine Eyes Have Drawn Thy Shape And Thine For Me

  Yet Eyes This Cunning WanttoGrace Their Art

Let Those Who AreinFavour With Their Stars
Of Public Honour And Proud Titles Boast
WhilstIWhom FortuneofSuch Triumph Bars

Great Princes Favourites Their Fair Leaves Spread
But AstheMarigold AttheSuns Eye
AndinThemselves Their Pride Lies Buried

To Witness Duty NottoShow My Wit

But ThatIHope Some Good ConceitofThine
In Thy Souls Thought All Naked Will Bestow It
Till Whatsoever Star That Guides My Moving
Points On Me Graciously With Fair Aspect
And Puts Apparel On My Tattered Loving
To Show Me WorthyofThy Sweet Respect
  Then MayIDaretoBoast HowIDo Love Thee
  Till Then Not Show My Head Where Thou Mayst Prove Me


                    

Weary With ToilIHaste MetoMy Bed
TheDear Respose For Limbs With Travel Tired
But Then BeginsaJourneyinMy Head
To Work My Mind When Bodys Works Expired
For Then My Thoughts From Far WhereIAbide
IntendaZealous PilgrimagetoThee
And Keep My Drooping Eyelids Open Wide
Looking On Darkness WhichtheBlind Do See
Save That My Souls Imaginary Sight
Presents Thy ShadowtoMy Sightless View
Which LikeaJewel HunginGhastly Night
Makes Black Night Beauteous And Her Old Face New
  Lo Thus By Day My Limbs By Night My Mind
  For Thee And For My Self No Quiet Find


                    

How CanIThen ReturninHappy Plight
That Am DebarredtheBenefitofRest
When Days OppressionisNot Eased By Night
But Day By Night And Night By Day Oppressed
And Each Though EnemiestoEithers Reign
DoinConsent Shake HandstoTorture Me
TheOne By ToiltheOthertoComplain
How FarIToil Still Farther Off From Thee
I TelltheDaytoPlease Him Thou Art Bright
And Dost Him Grace When Clouds Do BlottheHeaven
So Flatter ItheSwartcomplexioned Night
When Sparkling Stars Twire Not Thou GildsttheEven
  But Day Doth Daily Draw My Sorrows Longer
  And Night Doth Nightly Make Griefs Length Seem Stronger


                    

WheninDisgrace With Fortune And Mens Eyes
I All Alone Beweep My Outcast State
And Trouble Deaf Heaven With My Bootless Cries
And Look Upon My Self And Curse My Fate
Wishing Me LiketoOne More RichinHope
Featured Like Him Like Him With Friends Possessed
Desiring This Mans Art And That Mans Scope
With WhatIMost Enjoy Contented Least
YetinThese Thoughts My Self Almost Despising
HaplyIThink On Thee And Then My State
Like TotheLark At BreakofDay Arising
From Sullen Earth Sings Hymns At Heavens Gate
  For Thy Sweet Love Remembered Such Wealth Brings
  That ThenIScorntoChange My State With Kings


                    

When TotheSessionsofSweet Silent Thought
I Summon Up RemembranceofThings Past
I SightheLackofManyaThingISought
And With Old Woes New Wail My Dear Times Waste
Then CanIDrown An Eye UnusedtoFlow
For Precious Friends HidinDeaths Dateless Night
And Weep Afresh Loves Long Since Cancelled Woe
And Moan Th ExpenseofManyaVanished Sight
Then CanIGrieve At Grievances Foregone
And Heavily From WoetoWoe Tell Oer
TheSad AccountofForebemoaned Moan
WhichINew PayasIf Not Paid Before
  But IftheWhileIThink On Thee Dear Friend
  All Losses Are Restored And Sorrows End


                    

Thy BosomisEndeared With All Hearts
WhichIBy Lacking Have Supposed Dead
And There Reigns Love And All Loves Loving Parts
And All Those Friends WhichIThought Buried
How ManyaHoly And Obsequious Tear
Hath Dear Religious Love Stoln From Mine Eye
As Interest OftheDead Which Now Appear
But Things Removed That HiddeninThee Lie
Thou ArttheGrave Where Buried Love Doth Live
Hung WiththeTrophiesofMy Lovers Gone
Who All Their PartsofMetoThee Did Give
That DueofMany NowisThine Alone

  And Thou All They Hast AlltheAllofMe


                    

If Thou Survive My Wellcontented Day
When That Churl Death My Bones With Dust Shall Cover
And Shalt By Fortune Once More Resurvey
These Poor Rude LinesofThy Deceased Lover
Compare Them WiththeBettring OftheTime
And Though TheybeOutstripped By Every Pen
Reserve Them For My Love Not For Their Rhyme
Exceeded BytheHeightofHappier Men
O Then Vouchsafe Me But This Loving Thought
Had My Friends Muse Grown With This Growing Age
A Dearer Birth Than This His Love Had Brought
To MarchinRanksofBetter Equipage
  But Since He Died And Poets Better Prove
  Theirs For Their Style Ill Read His For His Love

And FromtheForlorn World His Visage Hide
Stealing UnseentoWest With This Disgrace
Even So My Sun One Early Morn Did Shine
With All Triumphant Splendour On My Brow
But Out Alack He Was But One Hour Mine
TheRegion Cloud Hath Masked Him From Me Now
  Yet Him For This My Love No Whit Disdaineth
  Suns OftheWorld May Stain When Heavens Sun Staineth


                    

Why Didst Thou Promise SuchaBeauteous Day
And Make Me Travel Forth Without My Cloak
To Let Base Clouds Oertake MeinMy Way
Hiding Thy BravryinTheir Rotten Smoke
Tis Not Enough That ThroughtheCloud Thou Break
To DrytheRain On My Stormbeaten Face
For No Man WellofSuchaSalve Can Speak
That HealstheWound And Cures NottheDisgrace
Nor Can Thy Shame Give PhysictoMy Grief
Though Thou Repent YetIHave StilltheLoss
Th Offenders Sorrow Lends But Weak Relief
To Him That BearstheStrong Offences Cross
  Ah But Those Tears Are Pearl Which Thy Love Sheds
  And They Are Rich And Ransom All Ill Deeds


                    

No MorebeGrieved At That Which Thou Hast Done
Roses Have Thorns And Silver Fountains Mud

And Loathsome Canker LivesinSweetest Bud

Let Me Confess That We Two MustbeTwain
Although Our Undivided Loves Are One
So Shall Those Blots That Do With Me Remain
Without Thy Help By MebeBorne Alone
In Our Two Loves ThereisBut One Respect
ThoughinOur LivesaSeparable Spite
Which Though It Alter Not Loves Sole Effect
Yet Doth It Steal Sweet Hours From Loves Delight
I May Not Evermore Acknowledge Thee
Lest My Bewailed Guilt Should Do Thee Shame
Nor Thou With Public Kindness Honour Me
Unless Thou Take That Honour From Thy Name
  But Do Not SoILove TheeinSuch Sort
 asThou Being Mine MineisThy Good Report

How Can My Muse Want SubjecttoInvent
While Thou Dost BreatheThat Pourst Into My Verse
Thine Own Sweet Argument Too Excellent
For Every Vulgar PapertoRehearse
O Give ThyselftheThanks If AughtinMe
Worthy Perusal Stand Against Thy Sight
For Whos So Dumb That Cannot WritetoThee
When Thou Thyself Dost Give Invention Light

Than Those Old Nine Which Rhymers Invocate
And He That Calls On Thee Let Him Bring Forth

  If My Slight Muse Do Please These Curious Days

O How Thy Worth With Manners MayISing
When Thou Art AlltheBetter PartofMe
What Can Mine Own PraisetoMine Own Self Bring
And What Ist But Mine Own WhenIPraise Thee
Even For This Let Us Divided Live
And Our Dear Love Lose NameofSingle One
That By This SeparationIMay Give
That DuetoThee Which Thou Deservst Alone
O Absence WhataTorment Wouldst Thou Prove
Were It Not Thy Sour Leisure Gave Sweet Leave
To EntertaintheTime With ThoughtsofLove
Which Time And Thoughts So Sweetly Doth Deceive
  And That Thou Teachest HowtoMake One Twain
  By Praising Him Here Who Doth Hence Remain


                    

Take All My Loves My Love Yea Take Them All
What Hast Thou Then More Than Thou Hadst Before
No Love My Love That Thou Mayst True Love Call
All Mine Was Thine Before Thou Hadst This More
Then If For My Love Thou My Love Receivest
I Cannot Blame Thee For My Love Thou Usest
But YetbeBlamed If Thou Thyself Deceivest
By Wilful TasteofWhat Thyself Refusest
I Do Forgive Thy Robbery Gentle Thief
Although Thou Steal Thee All My Poverty
And Yet Love Knows It IsaGreater Grief
To Bear Greater Wrong Than Hates Known Injury
  Lascivious GraceinWhom All Ill Well Shows
  Kill Me With Spites Yet We Must NotbeFoes


                    

Those Pretty Wrongs That Liberty Commits
WhenIAm Sometime Absent From Thy Heart
Thy Beauty And Thy Years Full Well Befits
For Still Temptation Follows Where Thou Art
Gentle Thou Art And ThereforetoBe Won
Beauteous Thou Art ThereforetoBe Assailed
And WhenaWoman Woos What Womans Son
Will Sourly Leave Her Till He Have Prevailed
Ay Me But Yet Thou Mightst My Seat Forbear
And Chide Thy Beauty And Thy Straying Youth
Who Lead TheeinTheir Riot Even There
Where Thou Art ForcedtoBreakaTwofold Truth
  Hers By Thy Beauty Tempting HertoThee
  Thine By Thy Beauty Being FalsetoMe


                    

That Thou Hast Her ItisNot All My Grief
And Yet It MaybeSaidILoved Her Dearly
That She Hath Thee IsofMy Wailing Chief
A LossinLove That Touches Me More Nearly
Loving Offenders ThusIWill Excuse Ye
Thou Dost Love Her Because Thou KnowstILove Her
And For My Sake Even So Doth She Abuse Me
Suffring My Friend For My SaketoApprove Her
IfILose Thee My LossisMy Loves Gain
And Losing Her My Friend Hath Found That Loss
Both Find Each Other AndILose Both Twain
And Both For My Sake Lay On Me This Cross
  But HerestheJoy My Friend AndIAre One
  Sweet Flattery Then She Loves But Me Alone


                    

When MostIWink Then Do Mine Eyes Best See
For AlltheDay They View Things Unrespected
But WhenISleepinDreams They Look On Thee
And Darkly Bright Are BrightinDark Directed
Then Thou Whose Shadow Shadows Doth Make Bright
How Would Thy Shadows Form Form Happy Show
TotheClear Day With Thy Much Clearer Light
WhentoUnseeing Eyes Thy Shade Shines So
How WouldISay Mine EyesbeBlessed Made
By Looking On TheeinTheLiving Day
WheninDead Night Thy Fair Imperfect Shade
Through Heavy Sleep On Sightless Eyes Doth Stay
  All Days Are NightstoSee TillISee Thee
  And Nights Bright Days When Dreams Do Show Thee Me


                    

IftheDull SubstanceofMy Flesh Were Thought
Injurious Distance Should Not Stop My Way
For Then DespiteofSpaceIWouldbeBrought
From Limits Far Remote Where Thou Dost Stay
No Matter Then Although My Foot Did Stand
UpontheFarthest Earth Removed From Thee
For Nimble Thought Can Jump Both Sea And Land
As SoonasThinkthePlace Where He Would Be
But Ah Thought Kills Me ThatIAm Not Thought
To Leap Large LengthsofMiles When Thou Art Gone
But That So MuchofEarth And Water Wrought
I Must Attend Times Leisure With My Moan
  Receiving Nought By Elements So Slow
  But Heavy Tears BadgesofEithers Woe


                    

TheOther Two Slight Air And Purging Fire
Are Both With Thee WhereverIAbide
TheFirst My ThoughttheOther My Desire
These Presentabsent With Swift Motion Slide
For When These Quicker Elements Are Gone
In Tender EmbassyofLovetoThee
My Life Being MadeofFour With Two Alone
Sinks DowntoDeath Oppressed With Melancholy
Until Lifes CompositionbeRecured
By Those Swift Messengers Returned From Thee
Who Even But Now Come Back Again Assured
Of Thy Fair Health Recounting IttoMe
  This ToldIJoy But Then No Longer Glad
 ISend Them Back Again And Straight Grow Sad


                    

Mine Eye And Heart Are AtaMortal War
HowtoDividetheConquestofThy Sight
Mine Eye My Heart Thy Pictures Sight Would Bar
My Heart Mine EyetheFreedomofThat Right
My Heart Doth Plead That ThouinHim Dost Lie
A Closet Never Pierced With Crystal Eyes

And By Their VerdictisDetermined

  And My Hearts Right Thy Inward LoveofHeart


                    

Betwixt Mine Eye And HeartaLeagueisTook
And Each Doth Good Turns Now UntotheOther
When That Mine EyeisFamished ForaLook
Or HeartinLove With Sighs Himself Doth Smother
With My Loves Picture Then My Eye Doth Feast
And TothePainted Banquet Bids My Heart
Another Time Mine EyeisMy Hearts Guest
AndinHis ThoughtsofLove Doth ShareaPart
So Either By Thy Picture Or My Love
Thyself Away Art Present Still With Me
For Thou Not Farther Than My Thoughts Canst Move
AndIAm Still With Them And They With Thee
  Or If They Sleep Thy PictureinMy Sight
  Awakes My HearttoHearts And Eyes Delight


                    

How Careful WasIWhenITook My Way
Each Trifle Under Truest BarstoThrust
ThattoMy Use It Might Unused Stay
From HandsofFalsehoodinSure WardsofTrust
But ThoutoWhom My Jewels Trifles Are
Most Worthy Comfort Now My Greatest Grief
Thou BestofDearest And Mine Only Care
Art LeftthePreyofEvery Vulgar Thief

From Whence At Pleasure Thou Mayst Come And Part
  And Even Thence Thou WiltbeStolnIFear

Against That Time If Ever That Time Come
WhenIShall See Thee Frown On My Defects
WhenasThy Love Hath Cast His Utmost Sum
CalledtoThat Audit By Advised Respects
Against That Time When Thou Shalt Strangely Pass
And Scarcely Greet Me With That Sun Thine Eye
When Love Converted FromtheThing It Was
Shall Reasons FindofSettled Gravity
Against That Time DoIEnsconce Me Here
WithintheKnowledgeofMine Own Desert
And This My Hand Against My Self Uprear
To GuardtheLawful Reasons On Thy Part
 toLeave Poor Me Thou HasttheStrengthofLaws
  Since WhytoLoveICan Allege No Cause


                    

How Heavy DoIJourney OntheWay
When WhatISeek My Weary Travels End
Doth Teach That Case And That ReposetoSay
Thus FartheMiles Are Measured From Thy Friend
TheBeast That Bears Me Tired With My Woe
Plods Dully OntoBear That WeightinMe
As If By Some InstincttheWretch Did Know
His Rider Loved Not Speed Being Made From Thee
TheBloody Spur Cannot Provoke Him On
That Sometimes Anger Thrusts Into His Hide
Which Heavily He Answers WithaGroan
More SharptoMe Than SpurringtoHis Side
  For That Same Groan Doth Put ThisinMy Mind
  My Grief Lies Onward And My Joy Behind


                    

Thus Can My Love ExcusetheSlow Offence
Of My Dull Bearer When From TheeISpeed
From Where Thou Art Why ShouldIHaste Me Thence
TillIReturnofPostingisNo Need
O What Excuse Will My Poor Beast Then Find
When Swift Extremity Can Seem But Slow
Then ShouldISpur Though Mounted OntheWind
In Winged Speed No Motion ShallIKnow
Then Can No Horse With My Desire Keep Pace
Therefore DesireofPerfectst Love Being Made
Shall Neigh No Dull FleshinHis Fiery Race
But Love For Love Thus Shall Excuse My Jade
  Since From Thee Going He Went Wilfulslow
  Towards Thee Ill Run And Give Him LeavetoGo


                    

So AmIAstheRich Whose Blessed Key
Can Bring HimtoHis Sweet Uplocked Treasure
TheWhich He Will Not Every Hour Survey
For BluntingtheFine PointofSeldom Pleasure

Or AstheWardrobe WhichtheRobe Doth Hide

  Blessed Are You Whose Worthiness Gives Scope
  Being HadtoTriumph Being LackedtoHope


                    

WhatisYour Substance Whereof Are You Made
That MillionsofStrange Shadows On You Tend
Since Every One Hath Every One One Shade
And You But One Can Every Shadow Lend
Describe Adonis AndtheCounterfeit

On Helens Cheek All ArtofBeauty Set
And YouinGrecian Tires Are Painted New

  But You Like None None You For Constant Heart


                    

O How Much More Doth Beauty Beauteous Seem

Of Their Sweet Deaths Are Sweetest Odours Made
  And SoofYou Beauteous And Lovely Youth
  When That Shall Fade My Verse Distills Your Truth

Of Princes Shall Outlive This Powerful Rhyme
But You Shall Shine More BrightinThese Contents

Nor Mars His Sword Nor Wars Quick Fire Shall Burn

Is It Thy Will Thy Image Should Keep Open
My Heavy Eyelids TotheWeary Night
Dost Thou Desire My Slumbers ShouldbeBroken
While Shadows LiketoThee Do Mock My Sight
Is It Thy Spirit That Thou Sendst From Thee
So Far From Home Into My DeedstoPry
To Find Out Shames And Idle HoursinMe
TheScope And TenureofThy Jealousy
O No Thy Love Though MuchisNot So Great
ItisMy Love That Keeps Mine Eye Awake
Mine Own True Love That Doth My Rest Defeat
To PlaytheWatchman Ever For Thy Sake
  For Thee WatchIWhilst Thou Dost Wake Elsewhere
  From Me Far Off With Others All Too Near


                    

SinofSelflove Possesseth All Mine Eye
And All My Soul And All My Every Part
And For This Sin ThereisNo Remedy
ItisSo Grounded InwardinMy Heart
Methinks No Face So GraciousisAs Mine
No Shape So True No TruthofSuch Account
And For My Self Mine Own Worth Do Define

But When My Glass Shows Me My Self Indeed

  Tis Thee Myself That For MyselfIPraise

With Times Injurious Hand Crushed And Oerworn
When Hours Have Drained His Blood And Filled His Brow
With Lines And Wrinkles When His Youthful Morn

And All Those Beauties Whereof Now Hes King
Are Vanishing Or Vanished OutofSight
Stealing AwaytheTreasureofHis Spring
For SuchaTime DoINow Fortify

That He Shall Never Cut From Memory

Since Brass Nor Stone Nor Earth Nor Boundless Sea
But Sad Mortality Oersways Their Power
How With This Rage Shall Beauty HoldaPlea
Whose ActionisNo Stronger ThanaFlower
O How Shall Summers Honey Breath Hold Out
AgainsttheWrackful SiegeofBattring Days
When Rocks Impregnable Are Not So Stout
Nor GatesofSteel So Strong But Time Decays
O Fearful Meditation Where Alack

Or What Strong Hand Can Hold His Swift Foot Back

Tired With All These For Restful DeathICry
AstoBehold DesertaBeggar Born
And Needy Nothing TrimmedinJollity
And Purest Faith Unhappily Forsworn
And Gilded Honour Shamefully Misplaced
And Maiden Virtue Rudely Strumpeted
And Right Perfection Wrongfully Disgraced
And Strength By Limping Sway Disabled
And Art Made Tonguetied By Authority
And Folly Doctorlike Controlling Skill
And Simple Truth Miscalled Simplicity
And Captive Good Attending Captain Ill
  Tired With All These From These Would IbeGone
  Save ThattoDieILeave My Love Alone


                    

Ah Wherefore With Infection Should He Live
And With His Presence Grace Impiety
That Sin By Him Advantage Should Achieve
And Lace It Self With His Society
Why Should False Painting Imitate His Cheek
And Steal Dead SeemingofHis Living Hue
Why Should Poor Beauty Indirectly Seek
RosesofShadow Since His RoseisTrue
Why Should He Live Now Nature Bankrupt Is
BeggaredofBloodtoBlush Through Lively Veins
For She Hath No Exchequer Now But His
And ProudofMany Lives Upon His Gains
  O Him She StorestoShow What Wealth She Had
 inDays Long Since Before These Last So Bad


                    

ThusisHis CheektheMapofDays Outworn

  And HimasForaMap Doth Nature Store

Those PartsofThee ThattheWorlds Eye Doth View
Want Nothing ThattheThoughtofHearts Can Mend
All TonguestheVoiceofSouls Give Thee That Due
Uttering Bare Truth Even SoasFoes Commend
Thy Outward Thus With Outward PraiseisCrowned
But Those Same Tongues That Give Thee So Thine Own
In Other Accents Do This Praise Confound
By Seeing Farther ThantheEye Hath Shown

And ThatinGuess They Measure By Thy Deeds
Then Churls Their Thoughts Although Their Eyes Were Kind

  But Why Thy Odour Matcheth Not Thy Show

Yet This Thy Praise CannotbeSo Thy Praise

  If Some SuspectofIll Masked Not Thy Show
  Then Thou Alone KingdomsofHearts Shouldst Owe


                    

No Longer Mourn For Me WhenIAm Dead

Nay If You Read This Line Remember Not
TheHand That Writ It ForILove You So
That IinYour Sweet Thoughts WouldbeForgot
If Thinking On Me Then Should Make You Woe
O IfISay You Look Upon This Verse

But Let Your Love Even With My Life Decay
  LesttheWise World Should Look Into Your Moan
  And Mock You With Me AfterIAm Gone


                    

O LesttheWorld Should Task YoutoRecite
What Merit LivedinMe That You Should Love
After My Death Dear Love Forget Me Quite
For YouinMe Can Nothing Worthy Prove
Unless You Would Devise Some Virtuous Lie
To Do More For Me Than Mine Own Desert
And Hang More Praise Upon Deceased I
Than Niggard Truth Would Willingly Impart
O Lest Your True Love May Seem FalseinThis
That You For Love Speak WellofMe Untrue
My NamebeBuried Where My Body Is
And Live No MoretoShame Nor Me Nor You
  ForIAm Shamed By That WhichIBring Forth
  And So Should YoutoLove Things Nothing Worth


                    

That TimeofYear Thou MaystinMe Behold
When Yellow Leaves Or None Or Few Do Hang
Upon Those Boughs Which Shake AgainsttheCold
Bare Ruined Choirs Where LatetheSweet Birds Sang
In Me Thou SeesttheTwilightofSuch Day
As After Sunset FadethinTheWest
Which By And By Black Night Doth Take Away
Deaths Second Self That Seals Up AllinRest
In Me Thou SeesttheGlowingofSuch Fire
That OntheAshesofHis Youth Doth Lie

ButbeContented When That Fell Arrest
Without All Bail Shall Carry Me Away

And ForthePeaceofYouIHold Such Strife
As TwixtaMiser And His WealthisFound

  Or Gluttoning On All Or All Away


                    

WhyisMy Verse So BarrenofNew Pride
So Far From Variation Or Quick Change
Why WiththeTime DoINot Glance Aside
To Newfound Methods AndtoCompounds Strange
Why WriteIStill All One EvertheSame
And Keep Invention InaNoted Weed
That Every Word Doth Almost Tell My Name
Showing Their Birth And Where They Did Proceed
O Know Sweet LoveIAlways WriteofYou
And You And Love Are Still My Argument
So All My BestisDressing Old Words New
Spending Again WhatisAlready Spent
  For AstheSunisDaily New And Old
  SoisMy Love Still Telling WhatisTold


                    

Thy Glass Will Show Thee How Thy Beauties Wear
Thy Dial How Thy Precious Minutes Waste
These Vacant Leaves Thy Minds Imprint Will Bear
AndofThis Book This Learning Mayst Thou Taste
TheWrinkles Which Thy Glass Will Truly Show
Of Mouthed Graves Will Give Thee Memory
Thou By Thy Dials Shady Stealth Mayst Know

Look What Thy Memory Cannot Contain
CommittoThese Waste Blanks And Thou Shalt Find
Those Children Nursed Delivered From Thy Brain
To TakeaNew AcquaintanceofThy Mind
  These Offices So OftasThou Wilt Look
  Shall Profit Thee And Much Enrich Thy Book


                    

So Oft HaveIInvoked Thee For My Muse
And Found Such Fair AssistanceinMy Verse
As Every Alien Pen Hath Got My Use
And Under Thee Their Poesy Disperse
Thine Eyes That TaughttheDumb On HightoSing
And Heavy Ignorance AlofttoFly
Have Added Feathers TotheLearneds Wing
And Given GraceaDouble Majesty
YetbeMost ProudofThat WhichICompile
Whose InfluenceisThine And BornofThee
In Others Works Thou Dost But MendtheStyle
And Arts With Thy Sweet Graces Graced Be
  But Thou Art All My Art And Dost Advance
 asHighasLearning My Rude Ignorance


                    

WhilstIAlone Did Call Upon Thy Aid
My Verse Alone Had All Thy Gentle Grace
But Now My Gracious Numbers Are Decayed
And My Sick Muse Doth Give An Other Place
I Grant Sweet Love Thy Lovely Argument
DeservestheTravail OfaWorthier Pen
Yet WhatofThee Thy Poet Doth Invent
He Robs TheeofAnd Pays It Thee Again
He Lends Thee Virtue And He Stole That Word
From Thy Behaviour Beauty Doth He Give
And Found ItinThy Cheek He Can Afford
No PraisetoThee But WhatinThee Doth Live
  Then Thank Him Not For That Which He Doth Say
  Since What He Owes Thee Thou Thyself Dost Pay


                    

O HowIFaint When IofYou Do Write
KnowingaBetter Spirit Doth Use Your Name
AndinThePraise Thereof Spends All His Might
To Make Me Tonguetied SpeakingofYour Fame
But Since Your Wort Wide AstheOcean Is
TheHumble AstheProudest Sail Doth Bear
My Saucy Bark Inferior FartoHis
On Your Broad Main Doth Wilfully Appear
Your Shallowest Help Will Hold Me Up Afloat
Whilst He Upon Your Soundless Deep Doth Ride
Or Being WreckedIAmaWorthless Boat
HeofTall Building AndofGoodly Pride
  Then If He Thrive And IbeCast Away
 theWorst Was This My Love Was My Decay


                    

OrIShall Live Your EpitaphtoMake
Or You Survive When IinEarth Am Rotten
From Hence Your Memory Death Cannot Take
AlthoughinMe Each Part WillbeForgotten
Your Name From Hence Immortal Life Shall Have
ThoughIOnce GonetoAlltheWorld Must Die

When You EntombedinMens Eyes Shall Lie
Your Monument ShallbeMy Gentle Verse

I Grant Thou Wert Not MarriedtoMy Muse
And Therefore Mayst Without Attaint Oerlook
TheDedicated Words Which Writers Use
Of Their Fair Subject Blessing Every Book
Thou ArtasFairinKnowledge AsinHue
Finding Thy WorthaLimit Past My Praise
And Therefore Art EnforcedtoSeek Anew
Some Fresher Stamp OftheTimebettering Days
And Do So Love Yet When They Have Devised
What Strained Touches Rhetoric Can Lend
Thou Truly Fair Wert Truly Sympathized
In True Plain Words By Thy Truetelling Friend
  And Their Gross Painting MightbeBetter Used
  Where Cheeks Need BloodinThee ItisAbused


                    

I Never Saw That You Did Painting Need
And ThereforetoYour Fair No Painting Set
I Found Or ThoughtIFound You Did Exceed
That Barren Tender OfaPoets Debt
And Therefore HaveISleptinYour Report
That You Yourself Being Extant Well Might Show
How FaraModern Quill Doth Come Too Short
SpeakingofWorth What WorthinYou Doth Grow
This Silence For My Sin You Did Impute
Which ShallbeMost My Glory Being Dumb
ForIImpair Not Beauty Being Mute
When Others Would Give Life And BringaTomb
  There Lives More LifeinOneofYour Fair Eyes
  Than Both Your Poets CaninPraise Devise


                    

WhoisIt That Says Most Which Can Say More
Than This Rich Praise That You Alone Are You
In Whose Confine Immured IstheStore
Which Should Example Where Your Equal Grew
Lean Penury Within That Pen Doth Dwell
ThattoHis Subject Lends Not Some Small Glory
But He That WritesofYou If He Can Tell
That You Are You So Dignifies His Story
Let Him But Copy WhatinYouisWrit
Not Making Worse What Nature Made So Clear
And SuchaCounterpart Shall Fame His Wit
Making His Style Admired Every Where
  YoutoYour Beauteous Blessings AddaCurse
  Being Fond On Praise Which Makes Your Praises Worse


                    

My Tonguetied MuseinManners Holds Her Still
While CommentsofYour Praise Richly Compiled
Reserve Their Character With Golden Quill
And Precious Phrase By AlltheMuses Filed
I Think Good Thoughts Whilst Other Write Good Words
And Like Unlettered Clerk Still Cry Amen
To Every Hymn That Able Spirit Affords
In Polished FormofWell Refined Pen
Hearing You PraisedISay Tis So Tis True
And TotheMostofPraise Add Something More
But That IsinMy Thought Whose LovetoYou
Though Words Come Hindmost Holds His Rank Before
  Then Others FortheBreathofWords Respect
  Me For My Dumb Thoughts SpeakinginEffect


                    

Was IttheProud Full SailofHis Great Verse
Bound ForthePrizeofAll Too Precious You
That Did My Ripe ThoughtsinMy Brain Inhearse
Making Their TombtheWomb Wherein They Grew
Was It His Spirit By Spirits TaughttoWrite
AboveaMortal Pitch That Struck Me Dead
No Neither He Nor His Compeers By Night
Giving Him Aid My Verse Astonished
He Nor That Affable Familiar Ghost
Which Nightly Gulls Him With Intelligence
As VictorsofMy Silence Cannot Boast
I Was Not SickofAny Fear From Thence
  But When Your Countenance Filled Up His Line
  Then LackedIMatter That Enfeebled Mine


                    

Farewell Thou Art Too Dear For My Possessing
And Like Enough Thou Knowst Thy Estimate
TheCharterofThy Worth Gives Thee Releasing
My BondsinThee Are All Determinate
For How DoIHold Thee But By Thy Granting
And For That Riches WhereisMy Deserving
TheCauseofThis Fair GiftinMeisWanting
And So My Patent Back AgainisSwerving
Thyself Thou Gavst Thy Own Worth Then Not Knowing
Or MetoWhom Thou Gavst It Else Mistaking
So Thy Great Gift Upon Misprision Growing
Comes Home Again On Better Judgement Making
  Thus HaveIHad Thee AsaDream Doth Flatter
 inSleepaKing But Waking No Such Matter


                    

When Thou ShaltbeDisposedtoSet Me Light
And Place My MeritinTheEyeofScorn

And Prove Thee Virtuous Though Thou Art Forsworn

Say That Thou Didst Forsake Me For Some Fault
AndIWill Comment Upon That Offence

Against Thy Reasons Making No Defence
Thou Canst Not Love Disgrace Me Half So Ill
To SetaForm Upon Desired Change
As Ill My Self Disgrace Knowing Thy Will
I Will Acquaintance Strangle And Look Strange
Be Absent From Thy Walks AndinMy Tongue

They That Have PowertoHurt And Will Do None

They Rightly Do Inherit Heavens Graces
And Husband Natures Riches From Expense
They AretheLords And OwnersofTheir Faces

TheSummers FlowerisTotheSummer Sweet
ThoughtoIt Self It Only Live And Die
But If That Flower With Base Infection Meet
TheBasest Weed Outbraves His Dignity
  For Sweetest Things Turn Sourest By Their Deeds
  Lilies That Fester Smell Far Worse Than Weeds

O WhataMansion Have Those Vices Got
Which For Their Habitation Chose Out Thee
Where Beautys Veil Doth Cover Every Blot

How LikeaWinter Hath My Absence Been
From TheethePleasure OftheFleeting Year
What Freezings HaveIFelt What Dark Days Seen
What Old Decembers Bareness Everywhere
And Yet This Time Removed Was Summers Time
TheTeeming Autumn Big With Rich Increase
BearingtheWanton Burden OfthePrime
Like Widowed Wombs After Their Lords Decease
Yet This Abundant Issue SeemedtoMe
But HopeofOrphans And Unfathered Fruit
For Summer And His Pleasures Wait On Thee
And Thou AwaytheVery Birds Are Mute
  Or If They Sing Tis With So DullaCheer
  That Leaves Look Pale DreadingtheWinters Near


                    

From You HaveIBeen AbsentinTheSpring
When Proudpied April DressedinAll His Trim

That Heavy Saturn Laughed And Leaped With Him

Or From Their Proud Lap Pluck Them Where They Grew
Nor DidIWonder AttheLilys White

  Yet Seemed It Winter Still And You Away

TheForward Violet Thus DidIChide
Sweet Thief Whence Didst Thou Steal Thy Sweet That Smells
If Not From My Loves BreaththePurple Pride
Which On Thy Soft Cheek For Complexion Dwells
In My Loves Veins Thou Hast Too Grossly Dyed
TheLilyICondemned For Thy Hand
And BudsofMarjoram Had Stoln Thy Hair
TheRoses Fearfully On Thorns Did Stand
One Blushing Shame Another White Despair
A Third Nor Red Nor White Had StolnofBoth
AndtoHis Robbery Had Annexed Thy Breath
But For His TheftinPrideofAll His Growth
A Vengeful Canker Eat Him UptoDeath

Where Art Thou Muse That Thou Forgetst So Long
To SpeakofThat Which Gives Thee All Thy Might
Spendst Thou Thy Fury On Some Worthless Song
Darkening Thy PowertoLend Base Subjects Light

And Gives Thy Pen Both Skill And Argument

  Give My Love Fame Faster Than Time Wastes Life
  So Thou Preventst His ScytheAnd Crooked Knife

My LoveisStrengthened Though More WeakinSeeming
I Love Not Less Though LesstheShow Appear
That LoveisMerchandized Whose Rich Esteeming
TheOwners Tongue Doth Publish Every Where
Our Love Was New And Then ButinTheSpring
WhenIWas WonttoGreet It With My Lays
As PhilomelinSummers Front Doth Sing
And Stops Her PipeinGrowthofRiper Days
Not ThattheSummerisLess Pleasant Now
Than When Her Mournful Hymns Did HushtheNight
But That Wild Music Burthens Every Bough
And Sweets Grown Common Lose Their Dear Delight
  Therefore Like HerISometime Hold My Tongue
  BecauseIWould Not Dull You With My Song


                    

Alack What Poverty My Muse Brings Forth
That Having SuchaScopetoShow Her Pride
TheArgument All Bare IsofMore Worth
Than When It Hath My Added Praise Beside
O Blame Me Not IfINo More Can Write

That Overgoes My Blunt Invention Quite
Dulling My Lines And Doing Me Disgrace
Were It Not Sinful Then StrivingtoMend
To MartheSubject That Before Was Well
FortoNo Other Pass My Verses Tend

  And More Much More ThaninMy Verse Can Sit
  Your Own Glass Shows You When You LookinIt

Ah Yet Doth Beauty LikeaDial Hand

So Your Sweet Hue Which Methinks Still Doth Stand

  For FearofWhich Hear This Thou Age Unbred
  Ere You Were Born Was Beautys Summer Dead


                    

Let Not My LovebeCalled Idolatry
Nor My BelovedasAn Idol Show
Since All Alike My Songs And Praises Be
To OneofOne Still Such And Ever So
KindisMy Love Today Tomorrow Kind
Still Constant InaWondrous Excellence
Therefore My VersetoConstancy Confined
One Thing Expressing Leaves Out Difference
Fair Kind And TrueisAll My Argument
Fair Kind And True VaryingtoOther Words
AndinThis ChangeisMy Invention Spent
Three ThemesinOne Which Wondrous Scope Affords
  Fair Kind And True Have Often Lived Alone
  Which Three Till Now Never Kept SeatinOne

In PraiseofLadies Dead And Lovely Knights
TheninTheBlazonofSweet Beautys Best

I See Their Antique Pen Would Have Expressed
Even SuchaBeautyasYou Master Now
So All Their Praises Are But Prophecies
Of This Our Time All You Prefiguring
And For They Looked But With Divining Eyes
They Had Not Skill Enough Your WorthtoSing
  For We Which Now Behold These Present Days
  Have EyestoWonder But Lack TonguestoPraise

TheMortal Moon Hath Her Eclipse Endured
AndtheSad Augurs Mock Their Own Presage
Incertainties Now Crown Themselves Assured
And Peace Proclaims OlivesofEndless Age
Now WiththeDropsofThis Most Balmy Time
My Love Looks Fresh And DeathtoMe Subscribes
Since SpiteofHim Ill LiveinThis Poor Rhyme
While He Insults Oer Dull And Speechless Tribes
  And ThouinThis Shalt Find Thy Monument
  When Tyrants Crests And TombsofBrass Are Spent


                    

WhatsinTheBrain That Ink May Character
Which Hath Not FiguredtoThee My True Spirit

That May Express My Love Or Thy Dear Merit
Nothing Sweet Boy But Yet Like Prayers Divine
I Must Each Day Say OertheVery Same
Counting No Old Thing Old Thou MineIThine
EvenasWhen FirstIHallowed Thy Fair Name
So That Eternal LoveinLoves Fresh Case
Weighs NottheDust And InjuryofAge
Nor GivestoNecessary Wrinkles Place
But Makes Antiquity For Aye His Page
  FindingtheFirst ConceitofLove There Bred
  Where Time And Outward Form Would Show It Dead

O For My Sake Do You With Fortune Chide

For Since Each Hand Hath Put On Natures Power

Sweet Beauty Hath No Name No Holy Bower

Therefore My Mistress Eyes Are Raven Black
Her Eyes So Suited And They Mourners Seem
At Such Who Not Born Fair No Beauty Lack
Slandering Creation WithaFalse Esteem
  Yet So They Mourn BecomingofTheir Woe
  That Every Tongue Says Beauty Should Look So

Whilst My Poor Lips Which Should That Harvest Reap

Thou Blind Fool Love What Dost ThoutoMine Eyes
That They Behold And See Not What They See
They Know What BeautyisSee Where It Lies
Yet WhattheBestisTaketheWorsttoBe
If Eyes Corrupt By Overpartial Looks
Be AnchoredinTheBay Where All Men Ride
WhyofEyes Falsehood Hast Thou Forged Hooks
WheretotheJudgmentofMy HeartisTied
Why Should My Heart Think ThataSeveral Plot
Which My Heart KnowstheWide Worlds Common Place
Or Mine Eyes Seeing This Say ThisisNot
To Put Fair Truth Upon So FoulaFace
 inThings Right True My Heart And Eyes Have Erred
  AndtoThis False Plague Are They Now Transferred


                    

When My Love Swears That SheisMadeofTruth
I Do Believe Her ThoughIKnow She Lies
That She Might Think Me Some Untutored Youth
UnlearnedinTheWorlds False Subtleties
Thus Vainly Thinking That She Thinks Me Young
Although She Knows My Days Are PasttheBest
SimplyICredit Her Falsespeaking Tongue
On Both Sides ThusisSimple Truth Suppressed
But Wherefore Says She Not SheisUnjust
And Wherefore Say NotIThatIAm Old
O Loves Best Habit IsinSeeming Trust
And AgeinLove Loves NottoHave Years Told
  ThereforeILie With Her And She With Me
  AndinOur Faults By Lies We Flattered Be


                    

O Call Not MetoJustifytheWrong
That Thy Unkindness Lays Upon My Heart
Wound Me Not With Thine Eye But With Thy Tongue
Use Power With Power And Slay Me Not By Art
Tell Me Thou Lovst Elsewhere ButinMy Sight
Dear Heart ForbeartoGlance Thine Eye Aside
What Needst Thou Wound With Cunning When Thy Might
Is More Than My Oerpressed Defence Can Bide
Let Me Excuse Thee Ah My Love Well Knows
Her Pretty Looks Have Been Mine Enemies
And Therefore From My Face She Turns My Foes
That They Elsewhere Might Dart Their Injuries
  Yet Do Not So But SinceIAm Near Slain
  Kill Me Outright With Looks And Rid My Pain


                    

Be WiseasThou Art Cruel Do Not Press
My Tonguetied Patience With Too Much Disdain
Lest Sorrow Lend Me Words And Words Express
TheMannerofMy Pitywanting Pain
IfIMight Teach Thee Wit Better It Were
Though NottoLove Yet LovetoTell Me So
As Testy Sick Men When Their DeathsbeNear
No News But Health From Their Physicians Know
For IfIShould DespairIShould Grow Mad
AndinMy Madness Might Speak IllofThee
Now This Illwresting WorldisGrown So Bad
Mad Slanderers By Mad Ears Believed Be
  ThatIMay NotbeSo Nor Thou Belied
  Bear Thine Eyes Straight Though Thy Proud Heart Go Wide


                    

In FaithIDo Not Love Thee With Mine Eyes
For TheyinTheeaThousand Errors Note
But Tis My Heart That Loves What They Despise
WhoinDespiteofViewisPleasedtoDote
Nor Are Mine Ears With Thy Tongues Tune Delighted
Nor Tender FeelingtoBase Touches Prone
Nor Taste Nor Smell DesiretoBe Invited
To Any Sensual Feast With Thee Alone
But My Five Wits Nor My Five Senses Can
Dissuade One Foolish Heart From Serving Thee
Who Leaves UnswayedtheLikeness OfaMan
Thy Proud Hearts Slave And Vassal WretchtoBe
  Only My Plague Thus FarICount My Gain
  That She That Makes Me Sin Awards Me Pain


                    

LoveisMy Sin And Thy Dear Virtue Hate
HateofMy Sin Grounded On Sinful Loving
O But With Mine Compare Thou Thine Own State
And Thou Shalt Find It Merits Not Reproving
Or If It Do Not From Those LipsofThine
That Have Profaned Their Scarlet Ornaments
And Sealed False BondsofLoveasOftasMine
Robbed Others Beds RevenuesofTheir Rents
Be It LawfulILove TheeasThou Lovst Those

Lo AsaCareful Huswife RunstoCatch
OneofHer Feathered Creatures Broke Away
Sets Down Her Babe And Makes All Swift Dispatch
In Pursuit OftheThing She Would Have Stay
Whilst Her Neglected Child Holds HerinChase

To Follow That Which Flies Before Her Face
Not Prizing Her Poor Infants Discontent
So Runst Thou After That Which Flies From Thee
WhilstIThy Babe Chase Thee Afar Behind
But If Thou Catch Thy Hope Turn BacktoMe

  So WillIPray That Thou Mayst Have Thy Will
  If Thou Turn Back And My Loud Crying Still

But Being Both From Me BothtoEach Friend
I Guess One AngelinAnothers Hell
  Yet This ShallINeer Know But LiveinDoubt
  Till My Bad Angel Fire My Good One Out


                    

Those Lips That Loves Own Hand Did Make
Breathed ForththeSound That SaidIHate
To Me That Languished For Her Sake
But When She Saw My Woeful State
StraightinHer Heart Did Mercy Come
Chiding That Tongue That Ever Sweet
Was UsedinGiving Gentle Doom
And Taught It Thus AnewtoGreet
I Hate She Altered With An End
That Followed ItasGentle Day
Doth Follow Night Who LikeaFiend

  And Saved My Life Saying Not You
